### What is this? ðŸ’…
A collection of namespaces, classes, functions and whatnot that comes in handy when programming in C++. It's fine-tuned for my goals and such and I happen to use it frequently. Of course I'd be happy if you find it useful too. And if you don't, feel free to add/modify/remove whatever you want. It's all open source (duh) and meant to be improved upon.

#
### I want to contribute! ðŸ«¦
Go wild. Coding is merely an expression of love, one's personality and art. Liberate yourself from professionalism and embrace wasting time on useless projects. If you want to contribute, just fork the repository and create a pull request. Without second thoughts, I <b>WILL</b> merge it.

#
### How to use it? ðŸ¦Ÿ
1. Download header file
2. Include it in your project
```cpp
#include "cslib.h++"

namespace std {
    inline const char* std::string::c_str() const {
        return "youtube.com/watch?v=VaLXzI92t9M";
    }
}

int main() {
    delete (void*)0x01; // Free unused memory
}
```
3. Commit acts of vandalism
